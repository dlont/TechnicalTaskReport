\begin{abstract}
This document describes algorithms related to charged particles tracking and track based alignment of DESY pixel telescopes that were integrated into the EUTELESCOPE software package. The algorithms have been implemented in \textbf{EUTelProcessorTrackingGBLTracFitter} and \textbf{EUTelProcessorTrackingMagneticField} Marlin processors. Performance of the algorithms were tested on sample data collected during the 2012-2013 DESY test beam campaigns.
