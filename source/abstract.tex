\begin{abstract}
This document describes algorithms for charged particles tracking in- and track based alignment of DESY pixel telescopes integrated into the EUTELESCOPE software package. The algorithms were implemented in \textbf{EUTelProcessorTrackingGBLTracFitter} and \textbf{EUTelProcessorTrackingMagneticField} Marlin processors.
