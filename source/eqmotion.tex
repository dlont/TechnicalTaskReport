\subsection{Motion of charged particles in magnetic field}
Motion of a charged particle in magnetic field can be described by a system of differential equations\cite{Spiridonov:2008ib}.
\begin{equation}
 \frac{d \vec{p}}{d t} = k \cdot Q \cdot \vec{v} \times \vec{B},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{p}$ - momentum vector of a particle in \GeVoverC, $Q$ - its charge in units of electron charge, $\vec{B}$ - magnetic field\footnote[1]{In what follows, a case of static magnetic field is implied.} strength in Tesla and coordinates of the position of the particle $x,y,z$ are in \cm.
